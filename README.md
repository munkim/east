Implementation of [EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03155.pdf) in MXNet.

The pipeline is simpler yet achieves almost the SOTA results. Among all nearly-SOTA models, EAST achieves F-score of 0.7820 at 13.2fps at 720p resolution. The current SOTA results (as of Oct 2017) in text detection is achieved by [Fused Text Detection Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.03272.pdf), which has a speed of 4 FPS on 848 Ã— 1500 images.
